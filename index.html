						<h2> ABOUT ME </h2>
						<hr>
						<p>	Hi, my name is Dariusz Markowicz and I am 25 years old. I am a university graduate, and I studied economics and computer science. 
							I am a self-motivated, responsible and hard working person. I am a mature worker and adaptable to challenging situations,
							both in a team environment as well as using my own initiative.
						</p>
						<p>	The reason why I started studying economics was that I wanted to start my own company in the design/construction industry. However, it changed at the beginning
							of 2014. When I started to be more interested in IT. A circumstance that contributed to my interest in this industry was reading about the shortage of 
							specialists in this field in the coming years (I asked myself - maybe this is something for me?). In those days, I knew almost nothing about programming languages.
							Earlier, it happened that I was writing a page on Joomla or an HTML page during classes in Computer Science in high school. As I mentioned, 
							my curiosity and satisfaction caused me to start writing programs. The first ones were in C. It was fascinating - to execute instructions on the console.
							I decided to change my field of study - with a bit of luck I passed the entrance examination, and at the same time I started a post-secondary vocational school with
							the profile of IT technician. To bring the computer world closer to me.Later, I learned C ++ as well as web technologies. Currently, I focus on the second direction 
							because it gives me the most satisfaction. I took seriously to learn and did not touch frameworks and libraries or templates until I learned the basics well. 
							I gave myself time to learn how to write code. So, I take two courses in programming: one direction allows me to understand what programming is, while front-end is
							for me what I want to do professionally. Here are the projects that I have realized, to develop myself in this field:
					 
					        <a href="http://www.obscurab.us" target="_blank"> obscurab.us</a> <span class="pngfiles-obscurabus"></span>
							<a href="https://github.com/dariodari0/Chess/blob/master/main.cpp" target="_blank">, and the chess game</a> <span class="pngfiles-commandline"></span>.
						</p>
						<p>
							I am building below website based on current trends in web design, but I am trying to apply my own interaction solution with the user, inspired by other websites - it allows me to maintain my enthusiasm and branden my expertise in the field.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently, my training focuses on React. Systematically, I gain knowledge and skills on technologies: AWS Cloud9, Mongo, Express by writing the TO-DO LIST application with its own API.
							Other issues are: ECMAScript2015-2017, SPA, D3, JSX, Virtual DOM, Authentication, React Router, Redux. 
							<br><br>
							I do not have professional experience in this industry so far and this is why I am eager to join the team who are excel in the field.

						<h2> HOBBIES </h2>
						<hr>
						<p> In my free time and sometimes instead of sleeping, I write code, a lot of code! I know that learning takes time so I spend my free time for it too!
							What's more, what I do for a form of relaxation are board and console games with friends. Sometimes, I decide: learn to play a new song on an 
							acoustic guitar, find a good TV series or a book title, look for alternatives and inspiration for example when I cook. Usually, I realize life 
							plans and solve problems definitively. Often, I think about the future and technological progress, analyze situations and then make conclusions. 
							It seems that I have one hobby - personal development.
